# Now
_Last update: {{ page.latest_update | date_to_string }}_

Here's what keeps me busy at the moment. [what?](https://nownownow.com/about)

## Taking a Breather
I guess the only time I manage to update this page is whenever there's some time to take a breather in my life. This time is no different. Until now, the year has been incredibly busy. Our team worked hard to design, build, and ship a new feature. And outside of work things haven't slowed down either. As spring is starting and Easter is around the corner, I feel how I'm slowly getting out of my rut that always keeps me low on energy during our long winters. I'm looking forward to taking a few days off next week for the Easter weekend to see friends and family, unwind, and just do whatever I'm up to for a few days.


## üë®‚Äçüíª Side Projects

### Ham's Hams
Over my Christmas break, I took the time to cure and cold-smoke my first ham. Over the course of 3 weeks I brined, smoked and dried about 2.5kg of pork to create my first dry-cured ham. I love the results and shared a bunch with friends and family. I really enjoyed taking the time to do what it takes to create something you can easily buy at the supermarket by hand to get an appreciation for the work and craft that goes into producing food we get to enjoy. If you're curious, you can see the results [on Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@ham/109642523986154607).

### [doppelkopf.party](https://doppelkopf.party) - A Doppelkopf Browser Game
Not many updates here. Contributions and improvements are sporadic but I did put in some work recently. One of the last big features missing is the ability to "play a solo" as you say in Doppelkopf terms. I've started building a user interface that lets you choose a solo before starting the game. That UI is now looking to be hooked up to the actual game but I didn't find the motivation to take this any further, yet.

As always, you can [check out the code on GitHub]((https://github.com/hamvocke/doppelkopf)).

### Elixir & Phoenix
I continue with my Elixir & Phoenix journey and try to fiddle around with this new stack on a side project whenever time & motivation hit right. I continue to be amazed how elegant Elixir as a language can be and how well Phoenix manages to build on top of that elegance. Together with [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto) it's a really well-designed and thoughtful combination of tools that's delightful (although sometimes alien) to use and that's inspired me to think about a few long-held beliefs slightly differently.

## üìö Reading
The last 3 books I've read, most recent at the top.

### _Hyperion_ and _The Fall of Hyperion_ by Dan Simmons

Encouraged by how much I enjoyed reading _Project Hail Mary_ by Andy Weir last year I
wanted to try some more Sci-Fi literature to see if the genre is in fact growing on me. I started picking up Dan Simmons' _Hyperion_ after a friend recommended it to me. It took me a bit to get into Simmons' style of writing but once I got into it I was hooked. _Hyperion_ has some fascinating world building. The different stories from different characters told throughout the first book left me excited, sad, thoughtful, and intrigued. Once I finished the first one, I immediately picked up the sequel and continue to have a great time seeing the whole story unfold.

### _The Staff Engineer's Path_ by Tanya Reilly

Tanya Reilly's [Being Glue](https://noidea.dog/glue) talk has been an eye-opening piece for me, helping me understand and identify some of the patterns I see in my daily job. When I saw her book _The Staff Engineer's Path_ being announced on O'Reilly, I immediately put it on my watch list and checked it out the day it was released. Once more, it's a super insightful, eye-opening read that helps me get a better grip on the things I've been doing as a tech lead and staff engineer for better or worse over the years. It's a book full of timeless advice and it feels like working with a much more experienced colleague who's sharing their hard earned wisdom with you as you need to hear it. I've never taking so many highlights and written down so many notes on any other book so far.
