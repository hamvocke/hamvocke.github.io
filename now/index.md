Here's what keeps me busy at the moment. [what?](https://nownownow.com/about)

## Keeping Things Balanced
As social live is getting back to normal around me, I really try to embrace it. Meet friends, have a meaningful social life, and try to get away from my computer, social media, and work-related stuff as much as I can. My day to day job can be pretty demanding and in the past I've learned that it's a slippery slope trying to do too much that overlaps with work after hours. To keep things balanced and keep myself healthy, I try to be very deliberate about the time I spend on technical reading, on social media, or in front of my computer - and instead try to go outside, do something constructive, or spend time with the people I love.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Side Projects

### [doppelkopf.party](https://doppelkopf.party) - A Doppelkopf Browser Game

This project started a few years ago when I started playing Doppelkopf (a popular German card game) with friends in Hamburg. A lot of time has passed, I've [written a thing or two](https://www.hamvocke.com/tags/doppelkopf/) about the project and occasionally I'm still tweaking things here and there. After so many years, my excitement died down a little although the game is not feature complete yet. The most prominent missing feature is playing solo. In the past few months I couldn't get myself motivated to invest more time into this project. Spending more time programming after a demanding day job that mostly revolves around programming just didn't sound too appealing while the sun was shining and social interactions slowly get back to normal. Maybe, if winter becomes a little more quiet, I'll find the motivation to get back in the saddle.

In the meantime you can [check out the code on GitHub]((https://github.com/hamvocke/doppelkopf)).

### Learning Elixir & Phoenix

[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is a programming language I've observed with a lot of curiosity for years now. I've dabbled with the language again and again, learned the syntax with the official docs, solved puzzles on exercism.io, and immediately got this warm and fuzzy feeling you get when you discover something that's just incredibly elegantly designed. I figured out that I wanted to use Elixir in anger but I never found a good case for it. I started playing around with [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/), a web framework for Elixir, a little more but was pretty intimidated by its learning curve. This year I took it as a challenge to push through this learning curve and build some small but non-trivial example with Phoenix. It took some time and my progress is slow (mostly due to fact that I'm deliberately not spending a lot of time in front of my computer outside of work) but I'm starting to get a better feeling for things. I decided to learn these things properly by going through the Pragmatic Bookshelf books ([Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/) and [Programming Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/titles/phoenix14/programming-phoenix-1-4/)) and I start to connect the dots and get a better feeling for the language's idioms.


## üìö Reading
The last 3 books I've read, most recent at the top.

### _Modern Software Engineering: Doing What Works to Build Better Software Faster_ by David Farley 

*"Continuous Delivery"* has easily been the most eye-opening book I've read in my career. As I revisited this faourite of mine earlier this year to help push for a CI/CD initiative at work, I discovered how David Farley, one of the "Continuous Delivery" authors has published a new book. *"Modern Software Engineering"* is a great book on how to apply an engineering mindset to building software, how to work in a way that emphasizes learning, and what it means to build software manageable in the face of complexity. Farley touches on a lot of fairly well-known aspects like modularity, cohesion and coupling, and separation of concerns, and manages to put them into context -- all while relentlessly making a case for TDD and test automation as tools to drive these ideas. To me, this is an instant classic and I know that it's going to be one of those books I will recommend to fellow new and seasoned developers.

### _Continuous Delivery Pipelines_ by David Farley 

For the same reason I revisited *"Continuous Delivery"*, I read through David Farley's more recently published "Continuous Delivery Pipelines" to see if I could <del>steal</del> <ins>take inspiration from</ins> some of his ideas for an initiative I led at work. As excited as I am about "Modern Software Engineering", I was severly disappointed by Farley's "Continuous Delivery Pipelines". It's a very high-level overview of the ideas outlined in the seminal "Continuous Delivery" book (by Farley and Jez Humble) but with much less depth. If you need a high-level introduction to the ideas behind Continous Delivery, this might be a good and quick overview - but you'll leave longing for much more depth. It's not really hands-on, lacking detail, and the editing seemed rather sloppy at times. Not my favourite - but maybe helpful for people who are completely new to the world of CD.

### _Project Hail Mary_ by Andy Weir

Oh, how I loved this book! I'm always struggling to find captivating fiction and often end up reading books that hardly get more than a "meh" reaction, but this book has been pure joy. There's something so fun, genuine, and uncomplicated about the main character who finds himself in a hopeless and desparate situation that had me longing for more.
