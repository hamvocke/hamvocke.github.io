In my daily work, I often switch between codebases. Each brings its own ecosystem of tools to create, manage, build and publish source code. One thing to help with the frequent switching is to have a single entry point to work with the source code in every project. I like to have a single wrapper script that allows me to run common commands I need for my daily developer life, no matter if I'm using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/), [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or a wild combination of tools under the hood.

At ThoughtWorks, we often call this a `go` script (which, admittedly, became confusing after _go_, the programming language, has become a thing). Teams at ThoughtWorks often create these scripts to make it easy run common tasks automatically: I can call `./go build` to compile my source code, `./go test` to run the test suite, or `./go run` to start the application locally, regardless of the tools that are used under the hood. [Pete Hodgson](https://twitter.com/ph1) wrote a nice series of articles [in praise of the go script](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/praise-go-script-part-i) to describe this practice in more detail ([Part II is here](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/praise-go-script-part-ii)).

Having a script as a single entry point makes your code more accessible to other developers (and your future self!). It's easy to do the things you want to do without memorizing long-winded commands. It's easy to switch between different projects as the commands stay mostly the same. And it's easy to discover what's possible (by running `./go help`) which helps getting new people up to speed. 

## `go` Scripts: An Example in Bash
Most of the `go` scripts I've seen were written in _bash_ and roughly followed the same structure of parsing the first parameter and then mapping that to certain actions:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

function usage {
  # print usage information
}

function build {
  # trigger build process
}

function test {
  # run test suite
}

if [[ $# -lt 1 ]]; then
  usage
  exit 1
fi

TARGET=$1
case $TARGET in
  "help" )
    usage
  ;;
  "build" )
    build
  ;;
  "test" )
    test
  ;;
  *)
    fail "Unknown command '${TARGET}'"
    usage
    exit 1
  ;;
esac
```

_Bash_ is a natural choice for simple automation tasks like this as it's often available on developer machines (and your continuous delivery server) and is undeniably powerful.

More recently I discovered that using [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) can be a better fit for what we're trying to achieve here. Let's see how.

## make and Makefiles
`make` itself is more powerful than what we're using it for here. Usually it's used for build automation and especially popular in the C/C++ universe for compiling source code but that doesn't stop it from being useful for other things.

If we want to use `make` as a simple wrapper to interact with our source code, we don't need all of its bells and whistles and can start with understanding a few basics:

`make` looks for a file called `Makefile` in your current directory to figure out what it's supposed to do. A Makefile is a plain text file that defines the different **rules** you can execute. 

A rule follows this pattern:

    target: dependencies
        system command to execute

The target defines how you call the rule from your command line. `make initialize-database` would look for a rule called _"initialize-database"_ and execute the commands you defined.

## An Example Using `make`
Let's assume, we have a Python codebase using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and want to have a simple way to perform three different actions:

1. run unit tests
2. start the application locally
3. run a code formatter

A corresponding `Makefile` looks like this:

<pre class="highlight"><code>.PHONY: test run format

test:
&#09;pipenv run pytest

run:
&#09;export FLASK_ENV=development && \
&#09;export FLASK_APP=myapp && \
&#09;pipenv run flask run

format:
&#09;pipenv run black myapp/</code>
</pre>

<div class="highlighted"><strong>Note</strong>: keep in mind that <code>make</code> is picky about indentation. You need to indent your commands with a <strong>Tab</strong>.</div>

Once we put this `Makefile` at the root of our project we can simply run `make test`, `make run` or `make format` from our command line to perform the tasks we defined.

## .PHONY targets
If you take a close look at the first line of our `Makefile` you'll see a line starting with `.PHONY:`:

```
.PHONY: test run format
```

This line declares all three of our targets as _phony_ targets, i.e. targets that do not produce or depend on files on our file system. [This answer on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2145605/208660) does a fantastic job of explaining what this is all about. In a nutshell: `make` usually expects to create files as output of the targets we run. If these files are in place, make won't do anything.

As an example:
Take the above Makefile. If we had a file called _"format"_ next to our Makefile and didn't declare the `format` target as a phony target, `make` would lazily refuse to do anything once we run `make format`. It would just claim:

```
make: `format' is up to date.
```

We can't avoid that someone creates a file with the same name as our make targets. To avoid breaking our make automation, we declare all our targets as phony targets. This way we're safe from running into the pitfall of having name clashes with files on our file system.

## Dependencies
One of the strengths of `make` is the possibility to declare dependencies between targets. Usually this is meant to work with files on our file system again but we can also use it to chain the rules we have created in our makefile.

Imagine you have a `clean` target that removes all compiled files from your file system. Occasionally you want to run the `clean` target by itself but you also want to run it every time before you compile your source code again (because you have way too much time at hand and incremental builds are just not your cup of tea ðŸ¤¨). In this case you could declare the `clean` target as a dependency for your `build` target and make would run `clean` every time before it runs the `build` target:

```
clean:
    rm -rf build/

build: clean
    # whatever you have to do to build your code
```

## Autocompletion
Another cool gimmick when using `make` is that some shells provide autocompletion for your targets, either out of the box or by installing a small utility package. [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) and [fish](https://fishshell.com/) support make autocompletion out of the box. If you're a [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) you can get autocompletion - not only for make - by installing [this package](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion).

With make autocompletion in place, you can start typing `make` in your command line and hit `tab` repeatedly to cycle through the available targets defined in your `Makefile`.

## Caveats
Using `make` is an easy way to make your project's source code easy to work with. Make certainly is powerful and that power comes with great responsibility. Makefiles can grow out of hand quickly. Personally, I wouldn't use `make` for anything that's way more complex than what we've outlined here. If you just need small wrappers around a certain set of commands, `make` is a good way to go. It's available on most systems and your `Makefile` can be simple and maintainable. As with every tool, you can go overboard easily and produce something that will haunt you for years to come.

Find your sweet spot, and don't forget what the people collaborating with you feel comfortable with. Just because you're cool with a big plate of Makefile spaghetti it might not be the best idea to write everything in make. My personal take is that if you need scripts that are more complex than a `verb` + `noun` combination (i.e. `go deploy production --version=latest` instead of `make test` or `go build`) you might want to look into something different than `make` - bash or your scripting language of choice being good options.
